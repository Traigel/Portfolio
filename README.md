# Hi, I'm Vladimir Traihel

I'm a developer with experience building SPAs using React/Redux/TypeScript/HTML&CSS/SCSS. I like to develop applications that bring real value to the end user. Now I am improving my skills in this area and expanding my knowledge with new technologies (Node.js). I spend my free time reading educational literature, as well as improving my English.
